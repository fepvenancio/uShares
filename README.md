# UShares Protocol

## Overview

UShares is a cross-chain yield protocol that enables users to deposit USDC into any ERC4626-compliant vault across different EVM chains using Circle's CCTP (Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol) and Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol).

For a detailed system architecture, please see the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) document.

## Features

- **Cross-Chain Deposits**: Deposit USDC into any ERC4626 vault across different EVM chains
- **Seamless Bridging**: Utilizes Circle's CCTP for USDC transfers and Chainlink's CCIP for data messaging
- **Yield Generation**: Access to various yield-generating strategies through ERC4626 vaults
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Works across all CCTP and CCIP supported EVM chains
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Complete web interface for wallet management, deposits, and portfolio tracking
- **On/Off Ramp Integration**: Built-in USDC purchase and selling capabilities
- **Real-time Tracking**: Subgraph-based analytics and position tracking

## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

- **UShares**: Main protocol contract handling deposits, withdrawals, and cross-chain operations
- **USharesToken**: ERC677 token representing user's share in the protocol
- **VaultRegistry**: Manages and validates ERC4626 vaults across chains

- **CCTPAdapter**: Handles Circle's CCTP integration for USDC transfers

## Next Steps Priority

1. Complete the core smart contract functionality:
   - Finish CCTP message handling
   - Implement proper attestation verification
   - Complete vault integration
2. Set up basic backend infrastructure:
   - Create basic API structure
   - Implement Circle CCTP integration
   - Set up monitoring system
3. Develop initial frontend:
   - Basic wallet integration
   - Simple deposit/withdrawal interface
   - Basic vault listing
4. Create subgraph:
   - Basic schema
   - Core event handlers
   - Essential queries

## Flow

### Deposit Flow

1. User connects wallet and selects a vault on any supported chain
2. User deposits USDC into the protocol
3. Protocol burns USDC and sends cross-chain message
4. On destination chain:
   - USDC is minted
   - Funds are deposited into selected vault
   - Receipt tokens are stored
5. On source chain:
   - uShares are minted to
   - Position is recorded

### Withdrawal Flow

1. User initiates withdrawal of uShares
2. Protocol burns uShares and sends cross-chain message
3. On destination chain:
   - Receipt tokens are redeemed
   - USDC is burned
4. On source chain:
   - USDC is minted to user
   - Position is closed

## Security

- Role-based access control
- Emergency pause functionality
- Rate limiting
- Comprehensive audit coverage
- Bug bounty program
